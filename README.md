# gpatch

gpatch is a language agnostic tool to perform collateral evolutions

## Inspiration

gpatch is largely inspired by [coccinelle](https://github.com/coccinelle/coccinelle).
The reason of gpatch is to perform collateral evolutions on any source code.
One drawback is patches it handles are not as powerful as coccinelle's semantic patches. For instance, it does not support isomorphisms.

## Limitations

gpatch does not preserve formatting.

## License

gpatch is distributed under the GPL-3.0 license.
